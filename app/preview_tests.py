    Tests are used here to check that the algorithm written
    is working as it should.

    It's best practice to write these tests first to get a
    kind of 'specification' for how your algorithm should
    work, and you should run these tests before committing
    your code to AWS.

    Read the docs on how to use unittest here:
    https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html

    Use preview_function() to check your algorithm works
    as it should.
